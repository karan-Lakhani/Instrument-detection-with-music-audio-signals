***Instrument Detection in Music Audio Signals***
This repository contains a project focused on Instrument Detection in Music Audio Signals using the IRMAS dataset. The goal of this project is to classify musical instruments present in audio recordings.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the IRMAS (Instrument Recognition in Musical Audio Signals) dataset. This dataset contains audio clips labeled with the musical instruments they feature. It is widely used for research in music information retrieval.

Due to the large size of the dataset, only a sample has been included in this repository. You can download the full dataset from the following link:

**Sample Data in This Repository**
A subset of the IRMAS dataset has been uploaded to this repository to showcase the implementation. It contains only a fraction of the full dataset for demonstration and testing purposes.
